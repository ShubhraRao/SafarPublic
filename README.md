# Safar - Public

Mobile application for public users to report potholes by two methods:
- Capture an image, which is then authenticated using our deep learning model
- Travel mode: Just turn on the mode and place your phone in a stationary position and our app will detect potholes based on in built sensors in your smartphone such as accelerometer and gyroscope

Other features:
